## My Recommendation

**For your agency, I recommend using the "Minimal Modern Logo"** (`stackwise-logo-minimal.svg`) as your primary logo because:

1. ✅ **Highly versatile** - works at any size
2. ✅ **Professional yet modern** - appeals to both startups and established businesses
3. ✅ **Instantly communicates "stacking"** - literal representation of layers
4. ✅ **Gradient adds personality** - without being too flashy
5. ✅ **Clean and memorable** - easy to recognize and recall
6. ✅ **Scales perfectly** - from favicon to billboard

The three colored blocks immediately communicate:
- **Technology stack** (your expertise)
- **Building/layering** (your process)
- **Progressive growth** (client outcome)

Plus, the gradient blue-to-purple matches your dark futuristic aesthetic perfectly!
