        q: "Who owns the code when it's done?",
        a: "You do. 100%. Every line of code, every design file, every asset we create belongs to you. We transfer full ownership upon project completion — no licensing fees, no strings attached. You get the complete source code, design files, and documentation.",
    },
    {
        q: "What if I don't like the design?",
        a: "We build in revision rounds at every stage. During Week 2, we present high-fidelity Figma prototypes before writing any code. You get 3 rounds of design revisions included in every package. If after all revisions you're still not satisfied, we'll redesign from scratch — that's our guarantee.",
    },
    {
        q: "Do you guys disappear after launch?",
        a: "Never. Every project includes 1-3 months of post-launch support (depending on your plan). After that, we offer monthly maintenance retainers starting at $199/month. We also provide detailed handoff documentation so your internal team can maintain the codebase independently if preferred.",
    },
    {
        q: "What's the typical project timeline?",
        a: "Most projects take 4-8 weeks from kickoff to launch. Simple websites: 2-3 weeks. E-commerce stores: 4-6 weeks. Complex web apps and SaaS: 8-12 weeks. We provide a detailed timeline during our free consultation call, and we stick to it — we've delivered 94% of projects on or ahead of schedule.",
    },
    {
        q: "How do you communicate during the project?",
        a: "You'll have a dedicated project manager and direct access to the developers via Slack/Discord. We send daily Loom video updates showing progress, weekly standup calls, and you'll have 24/7 access to a live staging URL to see your project come to life in real-time.",
    },
    {
        q: "What if the project scope changes mid-way?",
        a: "Scope changes happen — we get it. Minor additions (under 10% of project scope) are absorbed at no extra cost. For larger changes, we provide a transparent quote and timeline adjustment within 24 hours. No surprises, no hidden fees.",
    },
    {
        q: "Do you sign NDAs and confidentiality agreements?",
        a: "Absolutely. We sign NDAs before any discovery call where sensitive information is shared. Your business ideas, data, and proprietary information are protected by legally binding agreements. We take client confidentiality extremely seriously.",
    },
    {
        q: "Can I see real case studies before committing?",
        a: "Yes! We have detailed case studies for every major project we've shipped. During our free consultation, we'll share case studies specifically relevant to your industry and project type. You can also browse our portfolio section for project overviews right now.",
